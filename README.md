AutoParker is a contactless smart parking slot allocator web app. There are two sides to this application - an admin and a customer side. The admin can set information about the parking slots and view some analytics on the number of users per day in their dashboard. The customer can register in that place with a given parking id (the parking id should be made known to the user by the admin). He/She wil be allocated a parking slot. After allocation of the parking slots the customer can park and later login and perform a checkout paying the parking bill with the help of online transaction.
